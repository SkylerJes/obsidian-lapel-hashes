## ⚙️ Features

- Shows the heading level in the editor gutter (e.g. h1,h2,h3,..)
- Menu for quickly switching the heading level

## 💅 Customization

Each marker type can be targeted separately with CSS for easy customization. For example, if you want all H6s to look like burger menus, simply change the heading marker:

```css
.cm-heading-marker[data-level="6"] {
  --heading-marker: "☰";
}
```
